#x = "Python is a Snake"
#print(x)

#x = "Python"
#y = "is"
#z = "Awesome"

#print(x, y, z)

#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables

#x = "Python "
#y = "is "
#z = "Awesome"

#print(x + y +z)

#For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator
x = 15
y = 10

print(x + y)

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() 
# function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types
x = "10"
y = 15

print(x,y)
